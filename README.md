# HOW WE WORK?
<p>

Want to know how it actually works on our platform? 
We provide you with the best developers across the globe .

1. At first the user who is in search of teammates for a particular hackthon joins our platform.

2. A search box is provided with name tag, domain and most importantly skill tags which are necessary for any developer.
3. A database is already present on the backend of our platform linked with linkedIn and with also the developers who register on our platform.
4. The user in search can search for developers in a particular domain of work or with the required skills needed for the hackthon, the user wants to create a team for.
5. Data is fetched from our database and provided to the user , which contains the data of the best developers across the globe with the queried skill.
6. The user can then send a join request to the team he/she created for the hackthon.</p>
